# Wine

In 2014 I had written this small Perl script to fetch all the wines with a significant percentage of cinsault, from the Ch√¢teauneuf-du-Pape french AOC :
[fetch_wines_Chateauneuf.pl](https://github.com/EricCabrol/Wine/blob/master/fetch_wines_Chateauneuf.pl)  
The script was explained (in french) [here](http://eric.cabrol.free.fr/dotclear/index.php/2014/09/30/1395-data-digging-for-dummies).  I tested it again recently and it seems not to work anymore. I didn't check why.
