# Wine

In 2014 I had written this small Perl script to fetch all the wines with a significant percentage of cinsault, from the Ch√¢teauneuf-du-Pape french AOC :  
[fetch_wines_Chateauneuf.pl](https://github.com/EricCabrol/Wine/blob/master/fetch_wines_Chateauneuf.pl)  
Tested again recently it seems not to work anymore, and I didn't check why.
